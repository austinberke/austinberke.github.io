<p>Hello! I'm Austin Berke, a proud UCLA Bruin expecting to receive a B.S. in Computer Science in 2019. I have been fascinated by technology of all sorts for longer than I can remember (seriously, my Kindergarten teacher called home speechless at how I helped her attach a file to an email) and am always on the prowl to learn more. Most of my projects have been music-related because I simply love music – whether that be in the form of the <a href="#">social network I started in high school</a> or the <a href="#">program I wrote to sync up lights in my room to any given song</a>. I hope to further pursue my curiosities over the years to come, documenting my findings here along the way.</p>
