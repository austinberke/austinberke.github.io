<p>Hi! My name is Austin Berke, and I'm a proud UCLA Bruin expecting to graduate in 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have been dabbling in technology of all sorts for longer than I can remember (allegedly, in Kindergarten I walked my teacher through sending a file by e-mail when she couldn't figure it out) and am always on the prowl for more opportunities to learn. Music has always been a passion of mine, and as a result, most of my projects have been music-focused – whether that be in the form of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/austinberke#experience-411314406">social network I founded in high school</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/austinberke/MIDIToLED">program I wrote to sync up lights in my room to any given song</a>. I plan to further pursue my curiosities over the years to come, documenting my projects and little bits of insight here along the way.</p>
