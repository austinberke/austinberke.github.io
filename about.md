<p>Hello! I'm Austin Berke, a proud UCLA Bruin expecting to receive a B.S. in Computer Science in 2019. I have been dabbling in technology of all sorts for longer than I can remember (I'm not lying: allegedly, I walked my Kindergarten teacher through sending a file by e-mail when she was stuck) and am always on the prowl for more knowledge. Music is my passion, and as a result most of my projects have been music-related – whether that be in the form of the <a href="#">social network I founded in high school</a> or the <a href="#">program I wrote to sync up lights in my room to any given song</a>. I hope to further pursue my curiosities over the years to come, documenting my findings here along the way.</p>
